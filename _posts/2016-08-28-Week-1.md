title: A Different Experience

**What did you do this past week?**  
In this first week of classes, we got a feel for how the class is going to work. We looked at useful development tools (like Google Test and gcov) and used a basic Hello World program to observed the similarities and differences between C++ and Java. We also discussed the use of assertions and how they can be helpful or hurtful when debugging. All-in-all, it was a pretty normal first week. The biggest shock to me, however, was Prof. Downing’s teaching style. I’d heard about it from a few friends prior to taking this class, but I was still a little shocked when I heard him call my name. It’s really just not something that I’m used to. Most teachers just stand in front of the class, droning on about some new, unknown topic while many of the students zone out as they wait for it to end. Prof. Downing’s lectures focus a bit more on the social/interactive side of things. Before the class even started, he had us talk with some of our classmates and exchange phone numbers. During the lecture, he calls on a student t and has them explain the portion of code that we’re looking at. His lectures keep you engaged, and the possibility of getting called on in class forces you to stay on top of the readings and assignments, and gets us out of our comfort zone.

**What's in your way?**  
Quite a few things unfortunately. I have a bit of catching up to do. For starters, I don’t have a very sound background in git, and I have no experience coding in C++. I have coded in C before, but I’m not very comfortable with it. I also feel like I’m getting in my own way a little bit. I’m easily distracted, and for some reason that includes when someone's trying to get my attention. 

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week, I plan on setting up my work environment. I tried briefly earlier this week, but I didn’t get very far. I’m worried about whether or not my laptop will be able to handle the Docker container. I’ve been “borrowing” it since my laptop crashed last semester, but it’s slow. My previous computer works now, so I may switch back to using it. I’m just not sure how reliable it will be. I also plan on fixing up my blog, and making it look a little nicer.

**Pick of the Week**  
I don't have a pick of the week this week. Next week I'll make sure find something interesting.
