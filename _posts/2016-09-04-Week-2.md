We've begun the first project. It's been manageable, giving me plenty of time for my much much needed game of catch-up.

**What did you do this past week?**  
On Wednesday in class, we went over 3 types of caches (lazy, eager, and meta), and how they might be useful when optimizing our code for this project. On Thursday, Dr. Downing went over a possible todo list to help us get started, writing out even the most basic of steps. On Friday, we went into some detail about the differences between the prefix (++i) and postfix (i++) increment operators. We're also ~~forced~~ encouraged to use the issue tracker in github as a way to manage what we have left to do. This week, I started the project, and have completed a basic version of the program. I've spent the week getting used to C++, Docker, and git and feel a bit more comfortable with them now. I, of course, only know the basics of C++ and could probably stand to delve deeper into it. However, I'm definitely more comfortable than I was before, and that, at least, is something.

**What's in your way?**  
With this class, there are so many new tools that I have to get used to using, I just feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up. I also got started on this project a little bit later than I intended to. It's not really holding me back, but I'm a little disappointed as it's something that I know I need to work on.

**What will you do next week?**  
I have written a basic version of the project, but I haven't tested it in the UVa Judge yet. So, I will being doing that once I am finished writing this. Then, I will begin optimizing my code, trying to make it faster. I also still need to order the textbook for this class and plan on doing so this week.

**Pick of the Week**  
My tip of the week is to break your study time up with short breaks in between sessions. For me, I've found that with the short breaks, I retain more information and I'm am more focused while programming. This may be due to the [serial postion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect), which claimss that you're more likely to remember information at the beginning and end of your study sessions. If you increase the number of beginnings and ends, then
