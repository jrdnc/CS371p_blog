**What did you do this past week?**  
In class we've started talking about inheritance. Since Project 5 was released at the beginning of this week, we also looked at potential ways to set parts of it up. I had something else to do earlier in the week so I found a partner got started a little late. I've met with my partner a couple of times and we have a general idea of how we think our program is going to run. We still need to fix some syntax errors and add a few details more details to it, but I think we're off to a pretty good start. One of the issues that we're running into (again) is not being allowed to use getters and setters. It's just difficult to think of ways to gt around it. We also don't fully understand how to set up the handle class, so I'll need to look into that. After completing project 4 last week, another problem that I've run into is that I find myself trying to think of this project in terms of containment rather than inheritance. I kind of funny because that is the exact opposite problem I had last time.

**What's in your way?**  
I still have to work on a project for another class, so time management is something that I will need to pay attention to this week. Other than that I think I should be okay.

**What will you do next week?**  
My partner and I will continue to work the project. If I get some extra time, I might try to review a bit of what we went over earlier in the class.

**Pick of the Week**
